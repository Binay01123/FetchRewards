For this assesment, I worked with receipts.json, brands.json and users.json file to create ER diagram. Please refer to ERD.pdf for ER Diagram. Details about Data exploration using Python, T-SQL code and Message to stakeholders can be found in the notebook file. 
Thank you FetchRewards for this oppurtunity for this amazing learning experience.
